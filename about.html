              <p class="person-bio">
                I am a lifelong Franklin resident born and raised. As my kids
                were getting into activities around the Franklin community, I
                began coaching the various sports they were involved in.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was in these roles where I discovered how generous and kind
                this community is to everyone who comes into contact with it. My
                youngest son had gotten into the sport of racing and in order to
                support him in this, we began making trophies for the racing
                series. What started in my living room as a part time venture,
                grew quickly.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2007 we purchased a local trophy shop, which began the now
                bricks and mortar portion of "A Trophy Business". I have a
                passion for serving the partnering relationships this business
                has made with the organizations across this diverse community.

              <p class="person-bio">
                I have lived in Franklin since 1983. I am an Army Brat. I have 3
                children and 6 grandchildren. I worked at Alpine Electronics for
                18 years, manufacturing, working on machines. Then on to
                Firefighter & EMT, and continued on to become a Bachelors Degree
                Registered Nurse since 2004.
              </p>
              <p>
                We started our business in our garage. We were a racing family
                and needed extra income to supplement racing go karts parts and
                fees. We opened our business in 2005 with trophies and plaques.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have since added several different services to our business,
                and moved into our own brick and mortar building. We are happy
                to continue our business in Franklin, and throughout the state
                of Indiana.
